# Mandelbrot-Julia applet
Here you can find Java code, which implements drawing of Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Some simple GUI controls are also implemented. This Java applet was originally featured on [Physics of Risk](http://rf.mokslasplius.lt) blog, but was removed during the upgrade process as original applet description was written only in Lithuanian. English translation was not made, because we are phasing out Java applets.

Code was originally written in 2006-2008 and was recently cleaned up and translated to English.
